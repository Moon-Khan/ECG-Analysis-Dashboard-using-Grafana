# ECG Analysis Dashboard using Grafana

## Introduction

This repository contains code and configurations for setting up an ECG (Electrocardiogram) analysis dashboard using Grafana. Grafana is a popular open-source analytics and monitoring platform that allows users to visualize and analyze data from various sources.

## Installation

Grafana can be installed on various platforms, including:

- **Localhost**: Download and install a pre-built package for your operating system from the official [Grafana website](https://grafana.com/get).
- **Docker**: Use Docker containers for a lightweight and portable installation.
- **Cloud Platforms**: Many cloud providers offer managed Grafana instances for easy deployment (e.g., Azure, AWS, etc.).

Once installed, follow these steps to connect Grafana to your database:

1. **Access Grafana Configuration**: Navigate to the “Connection” section in Grafana’s web interface.
2. **Select Data Source**: Choose the type of database you want to connect to (e.g., PostgreSQL, MySQL, etc.).
3. **Configure Connection**: Provide the necessary connection details such as host, port, username, password, etc.
